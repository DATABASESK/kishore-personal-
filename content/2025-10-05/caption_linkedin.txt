Riddle Challenge Answer: The Power of the Meta Description

The key to this riddle is understanding what element is "found in search results," is a "snippet of text, short and sweet," and drives clicks. The answer is the META DESCRIPTION.

A well-crafted meta description is your elevator pitch in the SERPs. Itâ€™s what convinces a user to choose your link over a competitor's. Master this, and you master a fundamental pillar of organic traffic growth.

What's the one thing you always optimize for when writing yours (e.g., keyword, compelling call-to-action, emotional trigger)? Share your strategy!
